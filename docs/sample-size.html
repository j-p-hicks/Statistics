<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Overview</h2>
<p>A study’s sample size is the number of units of observation or sampling units that you collect data from, whether they are individuals, facilities, regions etc. Very broadly speaking, in an inferential study a sample size calculation is a calculation we can make to estimate the sample size we need our study to achieve to have a reasonable chance of answering our research question. In the calculation we define what we mean by a reasonable chance, and the reason we cannot guarantee that we will answer our research question in an inferential study is because we are basing our inferences on samples, which may or may not be representative of our target population due to sampling error (and that’s ignoring other sources of bias/error).</p>
<p>More formally, you make a series of assumptions, such as what level of variation in an outcome we expect to get in our sample, and then a sample size calculation can, in theory, tell you how large a sample size you need to get results with sufficient precision or power (we’ll come back to these concepts shortly). However, the validity or accuracy of a sample size calculation depends entirely on the validity/accuracy of the assumptions, as we’ll discuss. As always the important thing is to think carefully and critically when planning your sample size, and not just mindlessly plug in some optimistic values.</p>
<p>There are two main and distinct approaches typically used for calculating sample sizes for quantitative studies which can be thought of as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The confidence interval or precision based approach.</p></li>
<li><p>The hypothesis testing based approach.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In this practical we will make use of an online-based sample size calculator called Statulator. Before we go any further open the website here:</p>
<p><a href="http://statulator.com/" class="uri">http://statulator.com/</a></p>
<p>There are many, many, online-based sample size calculators, and many software based calculators too, and SPSS has a sample size “module.” However, I think Statulator is an excellent choice because it is browser-based, free, allows you to carry out a wide range of sample size calculations, is very user friendly, and has excellent explanations/help describing both the inputs and results of a sample size calculation (hover over the many “?” symbols and you’ll get excellent concise explanations of things like inputs to the sample size calculation).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Overview</h3>
<p>In summary, this is where we calculate the sample size we need to estimate our summary statistic of interest (e.g. a mean, proportion, or linear regression coefficient) with a given level of precision, by which we mean calculate confidence intervals around our sample statistic of interest that are no wider/larger than a pre-specified size/range, <em>assuming all the assumptions that go into the calculation are exactly true</em>. If you need a reminder of the distinction/definition of sample statistics and population parameters see below.</p>
<p>Population parameters and sample statistics:</p>
<div class="fold">
<p><br></p>
<p>Remember, population parameters are either the exact summary measures of a characteristics’ distribution in the target population, such as the exact mean age of individuals in the target population, or the exact summary measures of a relationship/association, such as the exact mean difference in systolic blood pressure between individuals aged &lt;40 compared to individuals aged ≥40 in the target population. And we estimate the likely values of population parameters, i.e. make statistical inferences about their likely values, which we can rarely if ever know for sure, based on: 1) the equivalent sample statistics that we calculate from our sample, such as the <em>sample</em> mean age of individuals or the <em>sample</em> mean difference in systolic blood pressure between individuals aged &lt;40 compared to individuals aged ≥40, and 2) the associated confidence intervals around those statistics. Or, if we are taking a hypothesis testing based approach to inference (see below), we estimate whether the population parameter of interest is likely to differ from some null hypothesis value based on a p-value calculated from the sample data.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>This approach can be used for any sample statistic including measures of relationships such as differences in means/proportions or regression coefficients, but the confidence interval approach is mainly used when the aim is to estimate sample statistics that describe the distribution of characteristics. This is typically in the context of a cross-sectional/repeated cross-sectional/longitudinal survey generating descriptive outcome measures for numerical or categorical variables in terms of means and proportions respectively. Note: any categorical outcome can be analysed as a series of binary outcomes based on each unit of observation having or not having the characteristic represented by each level of the categorical variable. For example, when sex is coded as having two levels, male and female, each level can be analysed as a binary variable, i.e. the proportion of individuals who are male (implicitly compared to the proportion who are not-male, i.e. female), or vice versa. Or for the categorical variable religion where we code it as having three levels, none, Christian, Muslim, we can analyse this as three related binary variables: religion-none = yes/no, religion-Christian = yes/no, and religion-Muslim = yes/no. Therefore, in many surveys most outcomes will be categorical variables (particularly from self-responses), and if there is no clear primary outcome the sample size is often based on obtaining a level of precision for a generic binary variable, when all categorical variables will be analysed as a series of binary variables (i.e. inferential statistics, namely confidence intervals, will be calculated for each binary variable).</p>

<p>Why is the confidence interval approach rarely used for analytical studies?</p>
<div class="fold">
<p><br></p>
<p>The lack of use of the confidence interval approach in these situations is probably because of the dominance of the null hypothesis significant testing (NHST) approach to analytical inference, which we’ll look at next, whereas with cross-sectional survey studies the main aim is often estimating a range of characteristics to a given level of precision rather than testing hypotheses. And as we will see below the when using a NHST approach then the more natural/logical sample size calculation approach is the hypothesis testing approach to sample size calculations. However, I would argue that given the benefits of using confidence intervals for making statistical inferences rather than NHST tests, we should make use of the confidence interval sample size approach as the norm.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Hypothesis testing based approach</h2>
<div id="overview-6" class="section level3" number="4.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Overview</h3>
<p>The hypothesis testing approach is primarily used for analytical studies that are trying to understand whether a given relationship exists. It is usually the case that the relationship of interest will be studied and analysed in terms of a difference in a continuous or binary outcome between two groups, which are usually independent groups but they can be related. However, the relationship may also be analysed in terms of a linear regression coefficient for a continuous independent variable, a logistic regression odds ratio, or other similar measure, but these are much less commonly seen. Also, as we explain below, in theory this approach can also be used for descriptive studies, but this is very rarely done. As these other approaches/scenarios are rarely/very rarely used we won’t look at them further and we below will just assume we are considering the approach where our relationship of interest is analysed in terms of a difference in a continuous or binary outcome between two <strong>independent</strong> groups.</p>
<p>The hypothesis testing approach is arguably harder to understand well than the confidence interval approach. It may be easiest to understand once you understand the process. Therefore, we will explain it in summary here by detailing the key steps you go through.</p>
<p>First, we pre-specify a target difference that represents the smallest difference in our outcome between the two groups that we want to be able to detect. This target difference also explicitly or implicitly incorporates our assumption about what level of variation will exist in the outcome variable in the sample data. We also pre-specify the threshold below which we would declare a p-value from a NHST test of the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the target population “statistically significant.” That is, the threshold below which we would reject the null hypothesis and assume that the alternative hypothesis of a difference existing in the target population was more likely. This is usually the conventional P ≤ 0.05 level.</p>
<p>Then the last main assumption is maybe harder to understand. Here we pre-specify the probability that we will obtain a p-value from a NHST of the the null hypothesis that is statistically significant based on our chosen threshold for significance (i.e. equal to or below our chosen threshold). Technically speaking this probability is the proportion/percentage of the time we would obtain a p-value from a NHST of the the null hypothesis that is statistically significant, based on our chosen threshold for significance, if we were to repeat the study an infinite number of times. The reason we can’t guarantee we will get a statistically significant p-value even if all our other assumptions are correct is because of sampling error. Even if the true difference in the outcome between the two groups that exists in the target population is equal to (or larger) than our pre-specified target difference, in any given randomly selected sample we might, due to sampling error, select a sample where the difference in the sample doesn’t reflect the difference in the target population and is in fact smaller. However, we can ensure that this only happens a given proportion of the time.</p>
<p>Then conditional on our assumption about the target difference in the sample data being exactly true, and conditional our assumption about the level of variation in the outcome in our sample data being exactly true, and conditional on their being no bias/error in the study and analysis other than sampling error, the resulting calculation will tell us what sample size we need to obtain to ensure that we have the pre-specified probability that we set of obtaining a statistically significant p-value when testing the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is quite a lot of technical terminology associated with this approach that we haven’t used yet for obvious reasons. However, we must familiarise ourselves with this terminology. First, the threshold at which we declare an effect statistically significant and reject the null hypothesis is known as the “alpha level” or the “level of statistical significance,” and the probability that we will be able to detect our target difference if it exists via getting a p-value less than our level of significance is known as the “power” of the hypothesis test. The power is also equivalent to 1 - “beta” (i.e. “1 minus beta”), where beta is the probability (in the long-run) of getting a false negative result, i.e. the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false. Therefore, power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false in the long-run assuming all assumptions that go into the sample size calculation are true.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why we need to pre-specify values for the alpha level and the power. Why not just set both to their maximum so that we always obtain a statistically significant result? The short answer is there is a trade-off with the resulting required sample size, and by convention researchers typically therefore set alpha to 0.05 (or less commonly 0.01) and power to 0.8 (or less commonly 0.9). See below for more details.</p>
<p>Why can’t we always minimise our alpha level and maximise our power?</p>
<div class="fold">
<p><br></p>
<p>More specifically, alpha is also the false positive rate of a hypothesis test, or the rate at which we will falsely declare a difference statistically significant in the long-run when conducting null hypothesis significance tests in a given scenario. Therefore, we want this to be as small as possible to avoid making mistakes, i.e. falsely declaring there to be a statistically significant difference, which we interpret to mean there is likely to really be a difference in the target population. However, the smaller we set the alpha level the larger the sample size required to detect any given difference as statistically significant for a given power (i.e. the larger the sample size required to detect any given difference as statistically significant with a given probability). Similarly, the higher we set the power level the larger the sample size required to detect any given difference as statistically significant for a given alpha level or level of statistical significance. This trade-off is simply a function of the maths underlying hypothesis testing approach sample size calculations: we need more statistical information and therefore a larger sample size to both reduce how often we make false positive decisions and increase how often we make true positive decisions from NHST. Similarly, for a given alpha and power level we require more statistical information or a larger sample size to detect as statistically significant smaller and smaller target differences (assuming they exist).</p>
<p>Therefore, for any given target difference we clearly want to minimise our level of statistical significance to reduce our false positive rate while maximising our power level to increase our chances of detecting statistically significant differences (assuming they exist!), while not requiring an unfeasibly large sample size. Consequently, typical values of alpha used in almost all sample size calculations are either 0.05 (the common statistical significance threshold) or less commonly 0.01 (i.e. 5% or 1%), while typical values for the power are 0.8 or less commonly 0.9 (i.e. 80% or 90% power). Very broadly speaking, these values typically allow you to come up with a feasible sample size calculation for not “unreasonably” small target differences. However, these are not magic values and they are very much arbitrary conventions with no logical or natural basis for them other than the fact that people like round numbers, and a 5% false positive rate (0.05) and an 80% chance of detecting a difference as statistically significant if it exists seemed like “reasonable” values to researchers who have gone before us, given how much these two values/assumptions “cost” in terms of the required sample size.</p>

<p>Hypothesis based approach to sample sizes for descriptive studies:</p>
<div class="fold">
<p><br></p>
<p>This hypothesis testing based approach can also be used for estimating sample sizes related to sample statistics that measure characteristics, e.g. means and proportions as estimated in a cross-sectional survey, if you wanted to test hypotheses about whether those characteristics differ from a given null hypothesis value (i.e. an assumed population value). However, this approach is almost only ever used to calculate sample sizes required for primarily analytical studies where the main research questions are about associations/relationships, and then this is usually typically further restricted/framed just in terms of differences between two groups, e.g. differences between two means or two proportions, where the intention is to use NHST to see whether the observed sample difference differs significantly from the assumed null hypothesis difference (usually of no difference).</p>

Note: in the literature the term “sample size calculation” is often used simply to mean the hypothesis testing approach, because outside of cross-sectional studies the confidence interval based approach is so infrequently used given the dominance of null hypothesis significance testing.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1.1</span> Scenario</h4>
<p>You work for a regional ministry of health in a region where public health facilities have reported increasing numbers of patients seeking treatment for cardiovascular diseases over the last decade. However, there is no good data on the cardiovascular health of the population. Therefore, your department has tasked you with conducting a population survey on the cardiovascular health of the population. As it is hard to measure actual cardiovascular health you will focus on systolic blood pressure as a key proxy indicator or risk factor for cardiovascular health. The primary aim of the survey is therefore to estimate the distribution of blood pressure, specifically systolic blood pressure (mmHg), values within the target population, along with collecting other relevant health and socio-demographic data. As the primary or key outcome variable is systolic blood pressure and your aim is to estimate the distribution of this outcome in the target population a confidence interval based approach to the required sample size makes most sense. This is because this approach will allow you to plan a sample size that will enable you to estimate the distribution of the outcome to a certain level of precision (i.e. to estimate it with a certain maximum confidence interval width).</p>
</div>
<div id="sample-size-assumption-inputs" class="section level4" number="4.4.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1.2</span> Sample size assumption inputs</h4>
<p>When estimating the sample size required to estimate a mean with confidence intervals of a maximum desired width there are just three assumption inputs to consider.</p>
<p>1. What confidence level do you want for your confidence interval?</p>
<p>The convention is a 95% confidence interval, and unless you have a good reason to choose otherwise use this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we will use <strong>95%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. What standard deviation (SD) is your outcome variable expected to have in your sample data?</p>
<p>This may be estimated from values in the literature from similar studies, or from pilot data (although this is risky as pilot studies by definition are small and cannot produce unreliable estimates of any sample statistics), or you can use the following rough rule of thumb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take the range of values for your outcome that roughly 95% of the population are likely to fall between/within. Divide this by 4 if you expect a sample size ≤70, or by 6 if you expect a sample size &gt;70 (almost always the case and what you should choose if unsure).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our example, in our scenario we might assume, from clinical knowledge/existing literature, that about 95% of people in our target population have systolic blood pressure values between 80 and 150 mmHg. Therefore, the expected range is 150 - 80 = <strong>70</strong>. We then divide this by 6: 70/6 = <strong>11.6</strong>. You should then round this up to at least 12 given it’s a rough estimate (and to be safer you might round up to the nearest “5” or even “10,” i.e. 15/20). That is, the larger the assumed standard deviation the larger the sample size required but the safer you will be because you have less chance of finding out that the standard deviation in your sample is actually higher than you assumed and you won’t then achieve your desired precision level. Note: this rule of thumb only applies to variables that are, at least approximately, normally distributed. See the following paper for an improved but slightly more complicated approach: <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-14-135" class="uri">https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-14-135</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we will use <strong>12 mmHg</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. What is the minimum level of precision that you want your confidence intervals to have?</p>
<p>This should be based on practical considerations, such as what level of precision will be useful for users of the results of the study such as clinicians, health administrators, and policy makers etc. Here we will assume that our result would only be judged to robust and useful by clinicians if our confidence intervals are a maximum of +/- 2.5 mmHg. This means that whatever mean we estimate we want the confidence intervals to be no wider than that mean plus 2.5 mmHg and that mean minus 2.5 mmHg. Note: the desired confidence interval precision does not depend on the likely/assumed value of the outcome. Also note: we have defined the precision of our desired confidence interval in terms of the “half-width” of the confidence interval, which is just the upper confidence interval value minus the lower confidence interval value (i.e. the confidence interval range) divided by 2. You will also often see this half-width referred to as the “margin of error”: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we will set our confidence interval half-width to <strong>2.5 mmHg</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. What response rate do you expect?</p>
<p>It is very rare to achieve a 100% response rate, so typically you should use previous values in the literature, if they exist, along with any pilot data, and past experience, to decide on a likely response rate. This should be a conservative/safe assumption, i.e. round down a “sufficient” extent, because experience shows researchers typically overestimate the response rate. For some Statulator sample size calculations you can enter the assumed response rate and it adjusts it automatically, but not for the estimating means tool. However, you can just adjust the sample size you get (which assumes a 100% response rate) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Response rate adjusted sample size = desired sample size / response rate (as a proportion)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, for the assumptions above as we’ll see the required sample size comes out as 92. If we assume we will get a response rate of just 90% or higher (0.9 on the proportion scale, i.e. 90/100), then we actually need to aim to collect a sample size of 92/0.9 = <strong>103</strong> (rounding up), i.e. we need to approach 103 people to end up with at least 92 who participate (assuming our response rate assumption is accurate). However, remember: while this will ensure that you have at least 92 individuals and that you achieve your desired level of precision, if peoples’ participation is related to their values of the outcome of interest then recruiting more people won’t stop your results from suffering response bias, i.e. the point estimate of the mean will not be representative of the point estimate of the mean in the target population.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we will assume a response rate of <strong>0.9</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<li><p>There are extra option available by clicking the <mark>Adjust</mark> button, but unless you know what you are doing and why leave them as defaults. Briefly though, the <mark>Adjust for t-distribution</mark> option means the sample size assumes that your analysis will use a t-distribution assumption for the outcome rather than a normal distribution. Remember the t-distribution is very similar to the normal distribution but just assumes slightly “fatter” tails that make for more conservative assumptions regarding how variable data are when the sample size is small. As this is the default in most analyses (independent t-test by definition and usually for linear regression tests of coefficients) it makes sense to leave this select as the default. We’ll explain a little about the <mark>Adjust for Clustering</mark> options later.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <mark>Close</mark> to close the adjust tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Then click <mark>Calculate</mark> to obtain the sample size needed to give you your desired 95% confidence interval margin of error (or half-width).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should then see that the calculator not only provides you with the required sample size but also explains it very helpfully as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming the expected population standard deviation to be 12, and employing t-distribution to estimate sample size, the study would require a sample size of: <strong>92</strong> to estimate a mean with 95% confidence and a precision of 2.5. In other words, if you select a random sample of 92 from a population, and determine the mean to be say y, you would be 95% confident that the mean in the population lies somewhere between y - 2.5 and y + 2.5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then remember as explained above we would want to adjust this for our expected response rate if it’s &lt;100%, and as shown above we simply divide our sample size by our assumed response rate and round up: 92/0.9 = 103. So our actual target sample size is <strong>103</strong>.</p>
<p>However, this result description doesn’t remind you of one very important fact that is easy to forget. If you achieve the required sample size you will only achieve your desired level of precision if the other assumptions in the calculation are accurate, i.e. if the SD of the outcome in the sample equals the assumed SD. If the actual SD in the sample data is larger than the pre-specified expected value then the precision you achieve, i.e. the half-width of the confidence intervals around your estimated mean, will be larger than your desired level of precision. Note: the opposite is also true, i.e. you’ll get better precision than expected if the SD turns out to be smaller than expected.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="additional-considerations" class="section level4" number="4.4.1.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1.4</span> Additional considerations</h4>
<p>What if you are estimating multiple means in a quantitative survey? For example, for our scenario where we are conducting a survey on cardiovascular health we might also measure salt intake, cigarettes smoked per day, BMI etc. Then you probably have two main approaches depending on the situation. First, if there is a clear, primary research question/objective then you can base the sample size of the outcome that allows you to answer that research question/acheive that objective. For example, if the primary aim of our survey was to estimate the distribution of systolic blood pressure in our target population then we could base the sample size on this outcome alone, and essentially hope that this is also a sufficient sample size to estimate our other numerical outcomes with sufficient precision. Second, if there is no clear, primary research question/objective then decide which outcomes you need to achieve a given level of precision for when estimating their distribution, and simply choose the sample size that is largest. That way you ensure that you will achieve at least sufficient precision for all your outcomes. For example, if we found we needed a sample size of 100 to estimate our systolic blood pressure outcome with sufficient precision and a sample size of 150 to estimate our salt intake outcome with sufficient precision, and these were our two key outcomes, then we would aim for a sample size of 150.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.1</span> Scenario</h4>
<p>You work for a regional ministry of health in a region where public health facilities have reported increasing numbers of patients seeking treatment for cardiovascular diseases over the last decade. However, there is no good data on the cardiovascular health of the population. Therefore, your department has tasked you with conducting a population survey on the cardiovascular health of the population. The primary aim of the survey is to estimate the prevalence of any previous cardiovascular events, e.g. myocardial infarction, strokes etc, based on self-reported responses, along with other relevant health and socio-demographic data. As the primary or key outcome variable is prior experience of a cardiovascular event this is a binary outcome (yes/no) and the logical/typical way to summarise such a variable is as a proportion, which would be equal to the “point prevalence” of this outcome in the target population. Therefore, a confidence interval based approach to the required sample size makes most sense here, because this approach will allow you to plan a sample size that will enable you to estimate the prevalence (i.e. proportion) of the outcome to a certain level of precision (i.e. to estimate it with a certain maximum confidence interval width).</p>
</div>
<div id="sample-size-assumption-inputs-1" class="section level4" number="4.4.2.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.2</span> Sample size assumption inputs</h4>
<p>When estimating a proportion for a binary outcome there are also three assumptions to input when calculating your sample size based on confidence intervals.</p>
<p>1. What confidence level do you want for your confidence interval?</p>
<p>The convention is a 95% confidence interval, and unless you have a good reason to choose otherwise use this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we will use <strong>95%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. What is your expected prevalence/proportion/percentage?</p>
<p>Remember, these are all equivalent measures but on potentially different scales, and you can covert between proportions and prevalences/percentages (prevalences are usually given as percentages, but can be given as proportions) by multiply/dividing by 100. We’ll just refer to the proportion from here on as that’s the scale that Statulator and most sample size calculators ask for.</p>
<p>Note: unlike for a mean and for technical reasons related to the assumed probability distribution that a binary variable follows we do not specify an expected level of variation in the outcome like a SD, because for a binary variable the variation is assumed to be related to the mean, i.e. to the underlying probability or proportion. Therefore, we just need to specify the assumed proportion. As with the SD, you may either base your expected proportion on prior estimates from the literature, and/or from pilot studies, or if there is no information to go on then the safest (most conservative) option is to use an expected proportion of 0.5. This is because for any given sample size the confidence intervals you obtain when estimating a proportion will be widest around a proportion of 0.5, so if you assume a proportion of 0.5 then whatever level of precision you pre-specify you will guarantee that you will achieve that level of precision (conditional on obtaining the required sample size) or greater (if the proportion turns out to be &lt;0.5 or &gt;0.5. Again, technically this is because the probability distribution of a binary variable assumes that the variance is greatest when the underlying probability (i.e. proportion) is 0.5, and declines proportionally for values &lt;0.5 or &gt;0.5.</p>
<p>However, an assumption of a proportion of 0.5 can be very conservative and result in a much larger sample size than might be necessary even if you are “playing it safe.” Therefore, it’s usually best to play around with this assumption based on your best estimate/guess and see how conservative you can go while still requiring a feasible sample size. For example, if you think the proportion of people having experienced cardiovascular events previously is unlikely to much more than 0.05 (5%) then it doesn’t make sense to assume a proportion 0.5 as it’s very unlikely that you’d be this wrong. But you may think it’s worth assuming a proportion of, say, 0.1, to be safe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we’ll assume a proportion of <strong>0.1 (10%)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. What is the minimum level of precision that you want your confidence intervals to have?</p>
<p>The same considerations apply as for the case when estimating a mean, i.e. consider the practical implications and requirements of your results. However, unlike for continuous outcomes the level of precision for a binary outcome can be specified in absolute terms or in relative terms, i.e. relative to the expected proportion. For example, if we set our expected outcome proportion to 0.1 (10%) then let’s say we want our confidence intervals to be no wider than the range: lower confidence interval = 0.05 (5%), upper confidence interval = 0.15 (15%). Then on on the absolute scale or in absolute terms our half-width is 0.05 or 5 percentage points, because our confidence interval range is simply our expected proportion plus or minus 0.05 or 5 “percentage points.” Note: loosely speaking percentage points are what you call differences between percentages when viewed on an absolute scale. If you are not clear on the difference between percentage points and percentage difference see here for more explanation: <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/percentage-points.html" class="uri">https://www.mathsisfun.com/percentage-points.html</a></p>
<p>However, on a relative scale our confidence interval half-width is 0.5 or 50%. This is because our confidence interval range is what we get when we take 0.5 or 50% of our expected proportion and add and subtract the result from our expected proportion:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>And then our lower confidence interval =</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And our upper confidence interval =</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are struggling to understand all this then don’t worry it is confusing and takes a while to “get your head around,” so keep at it. However, ultimately you don’t need to worry about these issues because you can just think about your desired upper and lower confidence interval limits that you want to have for your desired level of precision and then simply work out what they are on the absolute scale, because I’m sure you can even work this out in your head (e.g. if your expected proportion is 0.1 and your desired upper and lower confidence interval limits are 0.15 and 0.05 it’s easy to see your desired confidence interval half-width is just 0.05).</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we’ll assume we want a confidence interval that goes from <strong>0.05 to 0.15</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. What is your expected response rate?</p>
<p>As discussed for the estimating a mean situation if you expect &lt;100% response rate you should adjust the sample size for the assumed response rate. However, for the estimating a proportion tool we can do this automatically this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we’ll assume a response rate of <em>90% (0.9)</em>.</li>

<div class="fold">
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><p>From the <mark>Sample Size</mark> menu select <mark>Estimate a Single Proportion</mark>, then either leave your level of confidence at 95% (0.95) as per the default or change if necessary. Then enter your <mark>Expected Proportion</mark> as 0.1 and your <mark>Precision or Margin of Error</mark> as 0.05, ensuring that the <mark>Absolute value</mark> option is selected from the relevant drop-down menu (it is by default).</p></li>
<li><p>Then again there are extra option available if you click the <mark>Adjust</mark> button at the bottom left, including an option to adjust for the response rate. Therefore, click <mark>Adjust</mark> then tick the <mark>Adjust for Response Rate</mark> box and enter the <mark>Anticipated Response Rate:</mark> as 0.9. For the other options unless you know what you are doing and why then leave them alone!</p></li>
<li><p>Then click <mark>Calculate</mark> to obtain the sample size needed to give you your desired 95% confidence interval margin of error (or half-width).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should then see that the calculator not only provides you with the required sample size but also explains it very helpfully as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming that 10% of the subjects in the population have the factor of interest, and an expected response rate of 90%, the study would require a sample size of: <strong>154</strong> for estimating the expected proportion with 5% absolute precision and 95% confidence. In other words, if you select a random sample of 154 from a population, and determine that 10% of subjects have the factor of interest, you would be 95% confident that between 5% and 15% of subjects in the population have the factor of interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again though remember that achieving this level of precision depends on whether the estimated proportion in the sample data is equal to the expected proportion and on any other assumptions such as the true response rate being equal to your assumption. If the estimated proportion is further from 0.5 than your expected proportion (e.g. 0.07) then you will have better precision than your pre-specified level of precision, assuming your response rate is equal or better than the assumed rate, and similarly if your response rate is better than your assumed rate you will have better precision than your pre-specified level of precision, assuming the estimated proportion is equal to or further from 0.5 than your expected proportion. And vice versa, i.e. your precision will be worse than the pre-specified value if the estimated proportion is closer to 0.5 than the expected proportion and/or if the response rate is worse than the assumed rate.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1.1</span> Overview</h4>
<p>The typical scenario where you would use this type of sample size calculation is when the research question is concerning whether there is a difference in a continuous outcome (or a discrete numerical outcome if it behaves approximately like a continuous normally distributed variable) between two independent groups. The typical study design for such a research question would either an RCT (most robust) or some form of observational comparison design, like a cohort study or an uncontrolled before and after study if the before group was independent of the after group (less common). The typical analysis for such a research question in these designs would be via an independent t-test or a linear regression with a binary independent categorical variable (plus maybe additional independent variables).</p>
</div>
<div id="scenario-5" class="section level4" number="4.5.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1.2</span> Scenario</h4>
<p>You work for a research NGO in a country where public health facilities have reported increasing numbers of patients seeking treatment for cardiovascular diseases over the last decade. You have received funding to develop and pilot test an intervention that aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease in your country’s public health facilities. Briefly, as this is a pilot test you plan to select one typical health facility and use an (individually) randomised controlled trial to compare relevant patient health outcomes in patients who are randomly allocated to be diagnosed and treated using the new intervention processes to patients who are randomly allocated to be diagnosed and treated using the existing processes. As cardiovascular disease events are rare you will use systolic blood pressure as a proxy outcome for cardiovascular health/risk. You will measure a range of other outcomes (i.e. secondary outcomes) and relevant health and socio-demographic data to use as independent variables in your analysis. However, as systolic blood pressure is your sole primary outcome you will base the sample size on this outcome alone. The idea is that if the intervention appears potentially effective based on this pilot study a multi-facility cluster trial will follow to provide definitive evidence. Therefore, based on consultations with clinicians and health officials in your country it has been agreed/decided that the smallest mean reduction in systolic blood pressure which will considered clinically meaningful/significant, and therefore indicating that the intervention should be tested in a large-scale cluster trial, is 5 mmHg.</p>
</div>
<div id="sample-size-assumption-inputs-2" class="section level4" number="4.5.1.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1.3</span> Sample size assumption inputs</h4>
<p>There are more assumption inputs to consider when taking a hypothesis testing approach to sample size calculations, but several of the inputs are typically fixed at conventional levels - although this should never mean that you just mindlessly select those levels, there’s always room for thought!</p>
<p>1. What alpha (α) level or level of significance do you want?</p>
<p>The lower this is set the less likely the resulting hypothesis test is to generate a type I error or a false positive result on average (or in the long-run), assuming you achieve the required sample size and that all other sample size assumption inputs are accurate. However, the lower this is set the larger the sample size required holding all other assumption inputs constant, so there’s a trade-off with the sample size. By convention the level of significance is usually set to be 0.05 or 0.01, i.e. the levels at which we commonly determine statistical significance: when P ≤ 0.05 or less commonly P ≤ 0.01. Again this is probably because it’s a nice round number and assumed to be reasonable trade-off. Unless you have a good reason to change this and know what you are doing then leave this as the default 0.05.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we’ll leave the level of significance as its default at <strong>0.05</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. What power (1-β) do you want?</p>
<p>The higher this is set the more likely it is that the resulting hypothesis test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis, if the hypothesis is indeed false and the mean difference in the sample data is at least as large as the one assumed (see below), on average (or in the long-run), and assuming you achieve the required sample size and that all other sample size assumption inputs are accurate. However, again there is a trade-off: the larger this is set the larger the sample size required. By convention this is set at either 0.8 or less commonly 0.9. Again this is probably because it’s a nice round number and assumed to be reasonable trade-off. There’s absolutely no reason not to aim for a higher level of power though if you can afford the resulting sample size, and you can play around with this input and see how it affects your sample size.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll leave the power as its default at <strong>0.8</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. What is the expected difference in your outcome between the two independent groups (i.e. the expected difference in the two group means) and the expected variation in the outcome?</p>
<p>This is where we pre-specify the target difference that we want to be able to detect, which is a reduction of 5 mmHg in our scenario. In Statulator you can enter this information either in terms of the “Expected Means” or as an “Expected Difference between Means.” If you enter it as using the “Expected Means” option then you enter the expected “Mean of the Reference Group,” the expected “Mean of the Test Group,” and the expected “Standard Deviation.” For our scenario the expected mean of the reference group is the expected mean of the control or usual care group, while the expected mean of the test group is the expected mean of the new intervention group. However, for a sample size comparing independent means the actual means don’t matter, just their difference (e.g. a mean of 5 vs 10 requires the same sample size as a mean of 105 vs 110 as the difference is 5 in each case). Therefore, we can compare 0 (mmHg) in the reference group to 5 (mmHg) in the test group.</p>
<p>The expected standard deviation is the expected pooled standard deviation, i.e. assuming the outcome has the same standard deviation in both groups. As with the confidence interval approach to estimating a mean we can select this based on values in the literature, pilot data, and/or using the rule of thumb previously discussed. If you expect the standard deviation to be different in each group, which is often the case (e.g. outcomes in intervention arms are often less variable as processes are more standardised), then just use the bigger of the two standard deviations as the pooled standard deviation will always be smaller than this, i.e. it’s a conservative/safe approach. Let’s assume our expected standard deviation is 10 mmHg.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we’ll use the expected difference between means approach and enter the expected difference as <strong>-5</strong> (mmHg), i.e. a reduction of 5 mmHg, and the expected standard deviation as <strong>10</strong> (mmHg), to ensure we obtain a sample size based on our target difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the true difference in the target population is greater than this assumption then we’ll have more power on average than we expect. Note: it doesn’t make any difference to the calculation whether the target difference is positive or negative only the absolute value matters, so entering 5 or -5 won’t change the result.</p>
<p>4. What is the ratio of group sizes that you expect?</p>
<p>For any given total sample size, if the sample size in each of the two groups differs then you will not have the expected power that you pre-specified, and your power reduces as the ratio of group sizes gets further from 1 (i.e. the group sizes become increasingly different). Therefore, as it is common that you will not get exactly equal group sizes, and often quite different group sizes, you should always plan accordingly and build this into your sample size assumptions. As with the expected response rate it makes sense to base your assumed group size ratio on data from previous studies, pilot data, and/or past experience, and that you make it a conservative/safe assumption. Note: you adjust for non-equal group sizes by specifying the expected ratio of group sizes. In Statulator it asks for the ratio of the group size in the reference group compared to the test group. Therefore, you have to specify the ratio in terms of this direction of comparison.</p>
<p>However, as is commonly the case, if there is no reason to believe that any one particular group will be larger than the other, but there is reason to believe that one of the groups will be larger than the other but you just can’t predict which, then it’s probably easiest to just think in terms of how much larger in percentage terms one group is likely to be compared to another. If you then convert this percentage to a proportion and add it to 1 that’s your group size ratio. For example, if you believe one group is likely to be 25% larger than another then 25% = 0.25, and therefore our group size ratio is 1.25. As our scenario is that we are planning for an RCT, and you can usually guarantee a fairly equal group size ratio in an RCT, we’ll assume our group size ratio will be no more than 5% different in favour of either group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, we’ll assumed an expected group size ratio of <strong>1.05</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>5. What is the expected response rate?</p>
<p>As with the estimating a mean tool the independent group means tool doesn’t have an option to automatically adjust for the expected response rate and so we’ll have to do it manually.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll assume a response rate of <strong>0.9 (90%)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>From the <mark>Sample Size</mark> menu select <mark>Compare Two Independent Means</mark>. Then click the <mark>Expected Difference between Means</mark> option button and in the boxes that appear enter 5 (or -5, but again it makes no difference) in the <mark>Difference between Two Means:</mark> box and 10 in the <mark>Expected Standard Deviation:</mark> box.</p></li>
<li><p>Frustratingly we then have to first calculate our sample size before updating it with our other assumptions. I assume this is a slight bug in the Statulator tool code. If we instead first update our other assumptions via the <mark>Options</mark> tool and then click <mark>Calculate</mark> the sample size produced ignores any changes to the default assumptions in the <mark>Options</mark> that you make. Therefore, click <mark>Calculate</mark> and then click on the <mark>Options</mark> button at the bottom. You can set the desired level of significance (alpha) and power here, but as the defaults are alpha = 0.05 and power = 0.8 we can leave these alone. The next option available to change is the <mark>Alternate hypothesis</mark> option which lets you specify that you will be conducting a one-sided hypothesis. Unless you know what you are doing with this and why leave it on the default of a two-sided test, which will be the default for your analysis software. Lastly, let’s set the <mark>Group Sizes</mark> ratio to 1.05 and then click the <mark>Update</mark> button. Make sure you don’t then click the <mark>Calculate</mark> button as this updates the sample size back to the default assumptions on the options tool of equal group sizes etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Again the <mark>Adjust</mark> button at the bottom allows you to make additional assumptions, but unless you know what you are doing with these leave them on their defaults.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The sample size should now be suitably updated with our additional assumptions (just the group size ratio), and it should read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming a pooled standard deviation of 10 units, the study would require a sample size of: <strong>62</strong> for the test group and <strong>65</strong> for the reference group (i.e. a total sample size of <strong>127</strong>; to ensure that the Reference group is 1.05 times larger than the test group) to achieve a power of 80% and a level of significance of 5% (two sided), for detecting a true difference in means between the test and the reference group of 5 units. In other words, if you select a random sample of 65 from the reference and 62 from the test group (assuming unequal group sizes), and determine that the difference in the two means is 5 units, and the pooled standard deviation is 10 units, you would have 80% power to declare that the two groups have significantly different means, i.e. a two sided p-value of less than 0.05.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: we get separate sample sizes for each group. If they are equal you need to go back into the <mark>Options</mark> and ensure the group size ratio is correctly entered as 1.05 and click the <mark>Update</mark> button again and then make sure you <em>don’t</em> click <mark>Calculate</mark>! Also note: although we get separate group sizes if there was no reason to assume that any particular group will be bigger/smaller than the other group you would just aim to sample the total sample size and as long as your assumption about the group size ratio was accurate it wouldn’t matter which way around it occurs. And as always the accuracy of this sample size calculation depends entirely on how accurate all the assumptions in our calculation are.</p>

<p>The typical scenario where you would use this type of sample size calculation is when the research question is concerning whether there is a difference in a binary outcome between two independent groups (and remember you can always convert a numerical outcome to a binary outcome, and you can always convert a categorical outcome with &gt;2 categories into a binary outcome, although it may not always make sense to do so). The typical study design for such a research question would either an RCT (most robust) or some form of observational comparison design, like a cohort study or an uncontrolled before and after study if the before group was independent of the after group (less common).

<div id="scenario-6" class="section level4" number="4.5.2.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2.2</span> Scenario</h4>
<p>You work for a research NGO in a country where public health facilities have reported increasing numbers of patients seeking treatment for diabetes over the last decade. You have received funding to develop and pilot test an intervention that aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes in your country’s public health facilities. Briefly, as this is a pilot test you plan to select one typical health facility and use an (individually) randomised controlled trial to compare relevant patient health outcomes in patients who are randomly allocated to be diagnosed and treated using the new intervention processes to patients who are randomly allocated to be diagnosed and treated using the existing processes. You decide to define diabetes based on the international guideline of having a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/l, and your primary outcome will therefore be the binary outcome of whether a patient has a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/l or &lt;7.0 mmol/l, i.e. whether they currently “have” diabetes/not. You will measure a range of other outcomes (i.e. secondary outcomes) and relevant health and socio-demographic data to use as independent variables in your analysis. However, as having diabetes/not is your sole primary outcome you will base the sample size on this binary outcome alone. The idea is that if the intervention appears potentially effective based on this pilot study a multi-facility cluster trial will follow to provide definitive evidence.</p>
<p>Binary outcomes are naturally summarised as proportions/percentages, and a point prevalence is simply the proportion of individuals (or other units) that have a characteristic of interest at a certain point in time. Therefore, we can view our comparison of interest for our analysis as being a comparison between the proportion or point prevalence of diabetes in the intervention group compared to the proportion or point prevalence of diabetes in the control group.</p>
<p>Unlike when you are calculating a sample size when comparing independent means, as we’ll discuss further below, there are two complicating issues. First, it is not just the difference in the outcome between the two groups that affects the sample size but also the value of the outcome (i.e. the proportion) in the reference/comparison/control group. Second, we can specify the difference in absolute or relative terms.</p>
<p>For our scenario though we’ll assume that we have good data on the existing point prevalence of diabetes among patients being treated for diabetes (i.e. the proportion of patients who have a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/l) in public health facilities, and that this is no greater than 0.3 (30%). We’ll also assume that based on consultations with clinicians and health officials in your country it has been agreed/decided that the smallest reduction in the prevalence of diabetes which will be considered clinically meaningful/significant, and therefore indicating that the intervention should be tested in a large-scale cluster trial, is a reduction from 0.3 to 0.2 (i.e. from 30% to 20%).</p>
</div>
<div id="sample-size-assumption-inputs-3" class="section level4" number="4.5.2.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2.3</span> Sample size assumption inputs</h4>
<p>Several of the assumptions are identical to those for the comparing two means sample size calculation, and so we will not explain them again.</p>
<p>1. What alpha (α) level or level of significance do you want?</p>
<p>See the description in the comparing two means section above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, we’ll leave the level of significance as its default at <strong>0.05</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. What power (1-β) do you want?</p>
<p>See the description in the comparing two means section above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, we’ll leave the power as its default at <strong>0.8</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. What is the expected difference in your outcome between the two independent groups (i.e. the expected difference in the two group proportions)?</p>
<p>As mentioned the difference must be explicit about the outcome proportion expected in the reference/comparison/control group and it can be given either in absolute or relative terms. In Statulator the default is in absolute terms, and on the main page of the tool as we’ll see we can just enter our expected proportion for each group.</p>
<p>If you wish to enter the difference in relative terms then you can do so in Statulator by clicking the <mark>Alternatively, specify a Measure of Association</mark> link. This then allows you to specify an expected proportion in your reference group along with either a difference in proportions (actually still on an absolute scale), or a relative risk, or an odds ratio (both are obviously on a relative/ratio scale). We’ll stick with the default way to specify the difference by inputting the expected proportion for each group.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll therefore specify the expected proportion for the reference group as <strong>0.3</strong> and the expected proportion for the test (i.e. intervention) group as <strong>0.2</strong> to ensure we obtain a sample size based on our target difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the true difference we get is greater then we’ll have more power than we expect.</p>
<p>Note: due to the assumed distribution of the outcome in this type of sample size calculation any given absolute difference in proportions will require a larger sample size to detect (via a statistically significant hypothesis test) for a given power the closer the reference/comparison/control proportion is to 0.5. For example, for a given level of significance and power, you would require a much larger sample size to detect a difference if your reference group proportion was 0.4 and the test group proportion was 0.5 than if your reference group proportion was 0.1 and the test group proportion was 0.2. Therefore, to be conservative you should round any estimates of your expected reference group proportion towards 0.5. Therefore, if your expected reference group proportion is &lt;0.5 round it up towards 0.5 to be conservative, and if it’s &gt;0.5 round it down towards 0.5 to be conservative.</p>
<p>Also note: as the sample size calculation assumes that the outcome is binary it assumes that it is a binomial distributed variable. This means that the variance is a function of the mean (the assumed underlying proportion) and so we don’t specify an explicit expected level of variation in the outcome as the expected level of variation depends entirely on the expected proportion in each group.</p>
<p>4. What is the ratio of group sizes that you expect?</p>
<p>See the description in the comparing two means section above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again we’ll assume we have no reason to believe that either group will be larger than the other, but we do expect that one of the groups is likely to be larger than the other, and so we’ll assume a group size ratio of <strong>1.05</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>5. What is the expected response rate?</p>
<p>We can again now get Statulator to automatically account for a response rate &lt;100%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, we’ll assume a response rate of <strong>0.9 (90%)</strong>.</li>

<li><p>Now we can edit the additional assumptions accessed via the <mark>Adjust</mark> button at the bottom (i.e. click this). Leave the <mark>Apply Continuity Correction</mark> ticked.

Then tick the <mark>Adjust for Response Rate</mark> box and now enter the response rate as 90%.

In other words, if you select a random sample of 351 from the reference and 334 from the Test group (assuming unequal group sizes), and determine that 30% and 20% of subjects in the two groups have the factor of interest, you would have 80% power to declare that the two groups have significantly different proportions at a 5% level of significance.</p>

<p>You may notice there are a range of options available when calculating sample sizes for hypothesis tests (group comparisons) in the upper right corner of the screen on the Statulator sample size calculation pages, referred to as: “Equality,” “Non-inferiority,” “Superiority” and “Equivalence.” The Equality option is the default which will be used/selected unless you change it. These are different hypothesis testing “frameworks.” Note that for some reason Statulator uses the terminology for these approaches differently from what you will almost certainly see elsewhere. The default equality framework option in Statulator is what most references/researchers would call a “superiority” framework to hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two groups, and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference (i.e. one group is “superior” in terms of it’s typical outcome values than the other group) but it might be in either direction (hence a two-tailed hypothesis test). Hover over the “?” by these options to read the descriptions of which frameworks they apply to if you are interested, but unless you are very clear on the differences just leave it on the default equality option as this is the standard approach to sample size calculations for comparing groups as described above. If you wish to read about these frameworks (using the standard terminology) then there is a good paper on the topic available for free here: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18537788" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18537788</a></p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.7.1.1</span> Exercise 1: public primary-care health facility patient satisfaction survey</h4>
<p>For our survey we estimated that for any categorical outcome analysed as a series of binary outcomes (one per category level) we require a sample size of 481 (i.e. we need to try and recruit 481 patients into the survey) to achieve a 5 percentage point level of precision (95% confidence interval), assuming the proportion of any given binary outcome is 0.5, and assuming a response rate of 80%. We selected our desired level of precision based on discussions with key stakeholders.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.7.1.2</span> Exercise 2: pilot intervention study to reduce drug stock-outs</h4>
<p>We estimated that we required a total sample size of 94 health facilities, i.e. 47 per group, to detect a difference in the mean number of essential drug stock-outs during the three-month study period (the primary outcome) in the intervention group compared to the comparison group of -15 or greater, assuming a standard deviation of 25, based on a hypothesis test of the difference in the primary outcome between the two groups (assuming the outcome is t-distributed), with a level of significance of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. We also assumed a follow-up rate of 95%.</p>
<p>Note: the original total sample size was 88, but after adjusting for the assumed follow-up rate and rounding up the total was 93, but clearly if we are comparing two groups we then need to add 1 to this total to round up again to the nearest equal number, i.e. 94.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Reporting sample size calculations in methods sections</h2>
<div class="fold">
<p><br></p>
<p>For any methods and results reporting, such in a paper or report, you should explain what your study sample size was and how you calculated it, including all the assumptions that went into it. You should also report where any assumptions came from, i.e. what they were based on/how you chose them, unless they were chosen by convention, such as a 95% confidence interval or a level of significance of 5%. There is no set sequence in which you have to report the different assumptions/inputs used in your sample size calculation, but the below examples are one way you might do it. Lastly, you don’t have to explicitly state whether you are reporting a sample size calculated via a confidence interval or hypothesis testing based approach as this should be clear from the assumptions reported.</p>
<p>In the below examples we will not report any assumptions about the response rate or group size ratio, but if you make an assumption for these other than 100% or 1 respectively this should also be reported, and the basis for these assumptions justified. Also, the assumption values are just for illustration and not real!</p>
<div id="confidence-interval-based-sample-size-calculation" class="section level3" number="4.8.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.1</span> Confidence interval based sample size calculation</h3>
<p>When estimating a mean you simply need to report the expected standard deviation, the level of precision or margin of error, and the confidence level (this is often not presented, presumably because the assumption is 95%, but why not be clear?). You should also explain where your assumption of the expected standard deviation and level of precision came from.</p>
<p>Example methods reporting text for a confidence interval based sample size calculation for a survey of systolic blood pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li>We estimated that we required a sample size of 100 to estimate the mean of our primary outcome of systolic blood pressure (mmHg) with a level of precision (95% confidence intervals) at most ± 5 mmHg, assuming a standard deviation of 10. We based our assumption of the expected standard deviation on data from our previously reported pilot study (reference), which we rounded up from 7 to 10 to be conservative. Our level of precision was chosen based on consultations with relevant clinicians and health officials about what level of precision they required for usable results.</li>
</ul>
<p>When estimating a proportion you simply need to report the expected proportion, the level of precision or margin of error, and the confidence level. You should also explain where your assumption of the expected proportion and level of precision came from.</p>
<p>Example methods reporting text for a confidence interval based sample size calculation for a survey of hypertension prevalence:</p>
<ul>
<li>We estimated that we required a sample size of 100 to estimate the proportion of individuals with hypertension, which we assumed to be 0.3, with a level of precision (95% confidence intervals) where the lower limit was at most 0.25 and the upper limit was at most 0.3. We based our assumption of the expected proportion on data from our previously reported pilot study (reference) of 0.2, which we rounded up by 0.1 towards the most conservative value of 0.5 to be conservative. Our level of precision was chosen based on consultations with relevant clinicians and health officials about what level of precision they required for usable results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take care, when reporting the confidence interval ranges for your proportion/percentage that you are clear whether they are on an absolute scale (probably the easiest to understand and not misinterpret) or a relative scale.</p>
</div>
<div id="hypothesis-testing-based-sample-size-calculation" class="section level3" number="4.8.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.8.2</span> Hypothesis testing based sample size calculation</h3>
<p>For a hypothesis test based sample size calculation for a difference between two independent means you simply need to report the expected difference in means (or if you prefer the expected mean in each group) and the expected pooled (or common) standard deviation, plus your pre-specified level of significance/alpha and the power, and that you are using a two-sided hypothesis test (unless of course you are not). You should also explain where your assumption about the expected difference in means (i.e. the target difference) and the expected pooled standard deviation came from. Lastly, although it’s rarely done you should really also explain what distribution you are assuming your outcome follows. By default Statulator assumes the t-distribution for sample sizes when estimating a difference in means.</p>
<p>Example methods reporting text for a hypothesis test based sample size calculation for a study comparing the effectiveness of an intervention at reducing systolic blood pressure in an two-group comparison RCT:</p>
<ul>
<li>We estimated that we required a sample size of 100 to detect a reduction in our primary outcome of systolic blood pressure (mmHg) between our intervention and control arms that is at least 5 mmHg, based on a two-sided hypothesis test (assuming the t-distribution). This assumes a pooled standard deviation of 10 mmHg, the standard level of significance of 0.05, and a power of 0.8. Our target difference for detection was chosen based on consultations with relevant clinicians and health officials about what size of impact would be required for the intervention to be considered worth funding and scaling up. Our expected standard deviation was chosen based on values from relevant previous studies (references), which we rounded up from 7 to 10 to be conservative.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a hypothesis test based sample size calculation for a difference between two independent proportions you simply need to report the expected proportion for each group (or equivalently the expected proportion in the reference/control group and the absolute or relative expected difference in the proportional outcome, but this is arguably less easy to follow), plus your desired level of alpha and power, and that you are using a two-sided hypothesis test (unless of course you are not). You should also explain where your assumption about the expected difference in proportions (i.e. the target difference) came from.</p>
<p>Example methods reporting text for a hypothesis test based sample size calculation for a study comparing the effectiveness of an intervention at reducing the prevalence/proportion of individuals having hypertension in an two-group comparison RCT:</p>
<ul>
<li>We estimated that we required a sample size of 100 to detect a difference in the proportion of individuals with hypertension at study follow-up where we expect the proportion with hypertension in the intervention group is 0.2 and the expected proportion in the control group is 0.3, based on a two-sided hypothesis test. This assumes the standard level of significance of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. Our target difference for detection was chosen based on consultations with relevant clinicians and health officials about what size of impact would be required for the intervention to be considered worth funding and scaling up, with the expected proportion of individuals with hypertension in the control arm based on existing routine clinical data rounded up from 0.25 to 0.3 (towards the most conservative assumption of 0.5) to be conservative.</li>

<div id="compare-paired-means-or-proportions" class="section level2" number="4.9">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.9</span> Compare paired means or proportions</h2>
<p>We will not look at these sample size scenarios/approaches or practice them as they are not commonly needed, but they are for when your study design involves comparing means or proportions between two groups where those groups are not independent. For example, if you are comparing the change in systolic blood pressure (mmHg) in the same individuals where their systolic blood pressure is measured at two separate times, or where you are comparing the proportion of individuals with diabetes where that diagnosis is made at two separate times within the same group of individuals. Most of the assumptions that go into these calculations are exactly the same as for the calculations we’ve already covered and the rest you should be able to work out or get help with if you ever need to use them, which is not likely.</p>

<div id="adjusting-for-clustering" class="section level2" number="4.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> Adjusting for clustering</h2>
<div class="fold">
<p><br></p>
<p>We will not look closely at adjusting for clustering beyond saying that Statulator and many other sample size calculators offer the option to adjust for a clustered design. For example, if you collect data on pupils within difference schools those pupils within the same schools are likely to have correlated outcomes. Hence, you don’t have the same amount of statistical information as for a true simple random sample, which standard sample size calculations assume your sample data from. Therefore, unless you adjust for the “level of clustering” in your outcome you won’t achieve the level of precision or power that you expect to get from a given sample size even if all the other assumptions are accurate. There are different ways of measuring the “amount of clustering” in an outcome, and it’s a more advanced topic beyond the scope of this introductory course that you should seek assistance with if you need to carry out such a sample size calculation in the future.</p>
